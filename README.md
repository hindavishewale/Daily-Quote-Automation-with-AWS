# Daily-Quote-Automation-with-AWS
The Daily Quote Project is an automated cloud-based application that delivers motivational quotes to users every day through SMS and Email. The project leverages multiple AWS services to manage data, automation, and monitoring. Each component contributes to creating a seamless workflow without manual intervention.
